Key Project Takeaways
Task 1: Install and Setup of Langchain
• Need to obtain an API key from the OpenAI platform
• Set up the API key as an environmental variable in our Python code.
• Use PyPDFLoader library to upload the pdf file as input
Task 2: Define the summarize pdf function
• Use chunk_size and chunk_overlap to control the granularity of text splitting
• Create multiple documents to simplify text summarization
• Stuffing is the simplest method to pass data to a language model
Task 3: Add Prompt template to summarization function
• Prompt should be succinct and relevant to the context
• Prompts can be passed as a parameter to the LLM model via Langchaing module
• Unlike the Stuffing method, we need to define two prompts for the Map_Reduce method
Task 4: Build and test a GenAI app for PDF summarization
• Streamlit framework needs to be installed on Google Colab notebook
• Use st.text_input() to insert text boxes in web app
• Clicking the summarize button calls the summarize_pdf function at the backend
• Summarized output may vary based on the user prompts
